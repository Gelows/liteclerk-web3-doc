# Key Fields for Token Creation

<img src="/assets/XTERIUM-Landing.png" alt="XTERIUM-Landing" widht="300px">

When creating a token on the Polkadot network, whether through an EVM-compatible parachain (such as Moonbeam or Astar) or a custom parachain, several key fields must be defined to ensure your token is functional, secure, and integrated properly. These fields generally follow ERC-20 standards for tokens created on EVM-compatible parachains or similar standards for custom parachains.

## 1. Token Name
-  Description: This is the human-readable name of the token, which will appear on various platforms and exchanges.
-  Example: "Polkadot Token" or "MyCustomCoin".

## 2. Token Symbol
-  Description: A shorthand, uppercase abbreviation for your token. This symbol is often used on exchanges or dApps to represent your token.
-  Example: "DOT", "MCC", or "XYZ".
